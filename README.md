# loctweet
This website was created as a semestral project for a subject VIA at CTU Prague. It displays locations close to
your click, which are found by Twitter.

It uses Twitters API for getting particular locations from Twitters database. Then they are shown in a map,
which is created by Google maps API. For a part of the project, which has to use some own API, it uses API
sparks, where is stored a database of the last searched locations. It uses Twittie library for connection to
Twitter API and TwitterOAuth library for authorization. Design is a bootstrap template created by BlackTie.co.
